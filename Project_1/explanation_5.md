Explanation problem 5 : Blockchain
Implemented BlockChain as the linkedlist, but use the tmp bode to record the current node, then initilize a new node with previouse node pointing the the tmp node (previous node)
Time complexity for appending a block is O(1) and space complexity is O(n) which is total space that is occupied by blockchain.
