Explanation problem 6 : Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
For the union problem,I created a set for making union  Then I have created a new linked list (LinkedList object) from that set.
For the Intersection problem,I created a dict for making Intersection  Then I have created a new linked list (LinkedList object) from that set.

Time complexity for union is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).

Time complexity for intersection is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).
